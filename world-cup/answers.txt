Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
yes and start to be same after 10000 simulation.


Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
10000 simulation because it's accurate enough.
